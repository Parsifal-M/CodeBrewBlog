Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹!

Sorry if the title seems dramatic! This is just an update on the blog and what I have been up to.

I am a bad blogger, there are lots of things I want to talk about and write about but I just never seem to get around to it.

## What have I been up to?

Alot! The past few months I feel like professionally and personally I have been growing alot. I have been working on some really cool stuff at work and I have been learning alot about my craft. I am thankful to be in a small team with a senior engineer who is teaching me alot about software engineering and how to be a better engineer.

Most days I am mentally exhausted by the end of the day but I am learning so much and I am really enjoying it.

I have also been hard at work on some personal projects that I am hoping to put out into the world soon as "stable" versions and not just "proof of concepts".

## Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I was lucky enough to get a chance to "hop over" to Sweden for a few days to visit some good friends Anders and Johan (Thanks for hosting me guys!) and see Sweden's Styra HQ! We did some good OPA chatting and had some great food and some delicious beers and of course got to see some of Stockholm. It was also nice to see Spotify HQ and see where the magic happens on Backstage, the meetup was nice and it was great to meet some of the team in person. I will definitely be back to Stockholm soon!
