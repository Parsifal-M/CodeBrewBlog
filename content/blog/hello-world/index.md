Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Peter Macdonald, and I am a software engineer based in the Netherlands. I am a passionate advocate of open source and enjoy contributing to different projects in my free time. I live with my lovely wife and two cats, and I am a vegetarian.

Like many people, I used to suffer from imposter syndrome, which made me hesitant to contribute to open source projects. However, I have been working on overcoming this feeling, and although it still lingers, I have learned to cope with it.

Recently, I attended several conferences, including KubeCon 2022 in Valencia, Open Source Summit 2023 in Dublin, and FOSDEM 2023. These experiences opened my eyes to the vast and exciting world of open source, and I was thrilled to meet many like-minded people who share my passion for technology and innovation.

When I'm not contributing to open source projects or attending tech conferences, I like to unwind by playing video games. I own a Ps5 and sometimes play video games on my PC.

If you want to connect with me and talk about open source or tech stuff, feel free to https://t.co/firVTqlJDl.

Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for more!
