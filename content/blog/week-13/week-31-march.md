Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹!

This will be my attempt at writing weekly blog posts.

> It is currently week 13 in 2023. There are 40 weeks remaining.

Lets see how this goes.

# Week 13

## Backstage Launch

This week I have been pretty busy with preparing the launch of Backstage where I work, which has been quite the journey. No matter how many last minute changes you make, there is always something that you feel you should have done differently or are worried you have missed. I am sure that this is a feeling that many people can relate to.

## OPA Backstage Plugin

Super proud of the work that I have done on the OPA Backstage Plugin, I'm sure it still has some holes in it, but I think it is a good start. I have been working on it for a while now, and it is great to see it finally come to life.

I can see a lot of potential in this plugin, and I am excited to see where it goes and I hope it can be useful to others.

I will be writing a blog post about it soon, so keep an eye out for that.

## Open Source Contributions

As I have been pretty busy with the launch of Backstage, I haven't had as much time to contribute to open source which makes me sad. I have still been active in the communities I am part of and have been working on a few things, but I haven't had the time to finish them. I hope to be able to continue contributing soon!

## KubeCon

Super hyped for KubeCon this year, I am really looking forward to it. I am hoping to learn a lot and meet some awesome people, see some familiar faces and some good friends.

Comin' for yo swag! ðŸ¤£

## House Refactoring

We've been on a bit of a mission recently driven by my wife to change up the layout of our house. I also invested in a load of the Philips Hue lights which have been great! I think this weekend we will take a break from the reorganization and just chill out.

## Key Takeaways from the Week

My key takeaways from the week are:

- Launching Backstage has been a great experience and I am super proud of the work that we have done.
- I am excited to see where the OPA Backstage Plugin goes and I hope it can be useful to others, I will be writing a blog post about it soon and also doing a talk about this hopefully soon.
- I am looking forward to KubeCon this year, really looking forward to seeing some familiar faces and meeting some new people.
- I am looking forward to a chill weekend.
