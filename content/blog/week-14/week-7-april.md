Hi everyone üëã!

Another week has passed, and I am back with another weekly blog post.

# Week 14

## Jelly Legs

This week I did a talk where I work about our current implementation of Backstage. Anyone that knows me well, knows that I am quite shy and get nervous when I have to talk in front of people and sometimes struggle to get my point across. And in a room full of talented developers, this was somewhat daunting. 

However all things considered, I think it went very well. I am still not sure I am ready for the big leagues (looking at you KubeCon & Open Source Summit) but I am getting there.

Kudos to the other speakers that day, they all did a great job!

## OPA Backstage Plugin Update!

I have been working on the OPA Backstage Plugin this week and I am happy to say that I have made some good progress. I added some proper logging now (bye `console.log()`). Whats next? Well now I want to work on more fine grained permissions, so that you can have more control over what users can do, this means getting the user entity information from backstage and passing it to OPA.

## New Book üìö

I have bought myself the new book "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. I have heard a lot of good things about it and I am looking forward to reading it.

## Long Weekend Ahead üèñÔ∏è

We have some nice weather ahead of us this weekend, I am planning on going to the Amsterdam Bos and just chilling out maybe have a picnic or something and do a bit of reading and some walking.

## Defensive Programming üõ°Ô∏è

I keep coming across this topic of "Defensive Programming" and I want to learn more about it. I'd like to possibly write about it in a future blog post, so if you have any resources that you think I should check out, please drop a link!

I'd also like to when I better understand it do a talk about it.
