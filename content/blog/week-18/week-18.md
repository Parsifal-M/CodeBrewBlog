Hi everyone 👋!

KubeCon threw me a little off balance with the weekly blog posts, so I will try to make amends and do another post next Friday 12th to get back into the rythm.


## Spring is in the air 🌸

Although I am a winter fan, I have to admit that spring does make me feel happy. The sun is shining, the birds are singing and the flowers are blooming. It's a great time to be outside and enjoy the weather (even though I have ridiculous hay fever). Me and my wife have been going on a lot of walks and bike rides, which is great for the body and mind. There is something about a walk in the sun around a park that is just so soothing.

I am also a big bird lover so I love this time of year, I get to fill up all my bird feeders and watch the birds come and go. I have a few feeders in the garden and a few outside the window where I work. I have a few regulars that come and visit, but I am always on the lookout for new birds. I think the coolest one I have seen in the garden is a Eurasian Jay. But I also love watching the Ravens and Crows they are so curious and smart it's amazing to watch them.

## Birthday Vibes 🎂

May the 17th marks my 33rd birthday, I am looking forward to it as my parents are visiting for the week so we've booked a nice looking bistro/restaurant for the evening. I am also looking forward to showing them around Haarlem properly as last time we did not really get a chance as my Dad was helping sort out some things in the house that desperately needed sorting. 

I hope the weather is nice(r) a couple of beach days would be great!

## Hacking away 💻

I've been hacking away on my OPA Permissions Wrapper for Backstage I think it is basically finished now but there are still a few things I'd like to make better. I want the documentation to be solid and I think I can improve the OPA side of the documentation as well, I just need to brush up on a few tips and tricks to make it easy for people to adopt and use.

I have also been practising my TypeScript and React and make some fancy frontend plugins for special dropdowns in the Software Templates (Scaffolder) which I will also share once I am happy with them.

## I need to Go 👨‍💻

I miss using Go, I want to use Go again. I've been toying with some ideas to get back into it a bit more and I have a few ideas. I will also look at picking up some bugs or small features in the OPA project as I really enjoy working on that project and the community is great.

## Open Source Summit Europe 2023 🎟

Bilbao here we come! So excited to go to the Open Source Summit, I really loved it in Dublin and I am sure Bilbao will be just as good. I am also looking forward to seeing the city as I have never been before. Looking forward to some hopefully warm weather and nice sangria! Also keen on checking out the Guggenheim Museum. Look at it, it's amazing!
