Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹!

I thought it would be a good idea to keep this a little separate from the usual weekly posts. I will try to keep it short and sweet.

This was my second KubeCon event (the last being in Valencia in 2022). And this time it was right around the corner from me in Amsterdam, which is a short train ride away from Haarlem. I'm going to put down my general thoughts and feelings about the event and try not to go on and on. 

### The Venue (Rai, Amsterdam)

The venue this year was great, it was easy to navigate and there was plenty of space to move around, I found it a challenge in Valencia to find certain rooms and only by day 3 was I actually more or less comfortable finding them. The food was... not bad! I am not one to complain about free food but the way the food was handled this time was much better, hang up some bags labeled with your dietary preferences and let people come and grab em', no queues out the doors and little fuss.

Coffee was a bit of an issue because the coffee machines where proper coffee bean grinding ones, which meant that the coffee was great but the queues were long.

Breakfast was also quite good.

### The Talks

The talks this year for me were a bit of a mixed bag, I found that there were a lot of talks that were quite similar to each other and I found myself skipping some of them to walk the showroom floor and chat with people. I think this means that the community is starting to settle on certain ways of doing things and that the talks are starting to reflect that. GitOps was a big theme this year with many talks revolving around the subject, a long with a continued focus on security and observability.

My favourite talks were (in no particular order):

- [The Hackers Guide to Kubernetes](https://sched.co/1HyYW) by [Patrycja Wegrzynowicz](https://kccnceu2023.sched.com/speaker/patrycja3)
- [Cloud-Native Quantum: Running Quantum Serverless Workloads on Kubernetes](https://sched.co/1HyYN) by Michael Maximilien and [Paul Schweigert](https://psschwei.com/)
- [The Compliance Business Case For Kubernetes in the EU: Get Ready for EUCS](https://sched.co/1HyW6) by [Anders Eknert](https://hachyderm.io/@anderseknert)
- [ContribFest: OPA](https://sched.co/1HzdO)

### The Showroom Floor

Its probably no secret that KubeCon and the showroom floor can feel quite commercial, but I think that is to be expected. Its also a great place to meet people and chat about what they are doing and what they are working on and getting some ideas. And of course, the swag!

### The People

Probably my favourite part about these events (even though I am painfully introverted) is meeting people in the community and chatting with them, sometimes I learn far more just chatting with people around on the floor than in some of the talks (no offence to the speakers!). I met up with some good friends I've been lucky enough to make in the OS community and some I had made in Valencia (oh, and OSS in Dublin!), I also met some new people too who this was their first KubeCon it was nice to be able to answer some of their questions and help them out.

### General Thoughts

- GitOps is here to stay, its growing and its getting better and better.
- Security and Observability are still big topics and will continue to be (looking at you OpenTelemetry).
- The community is growing and its great to see so many new faces.
- No true after party this year, which was a shame.
- The venue was great and the food was okay.
- Platform engineering is now more of a thing but I think we're still figuring out what it means and where it fits in.
