Hi everyone 👋!

Um... Saturday blog 😛

# Week 15

## Easter Weekend 🐣

I hope everyone had a great Easter weekend! I had a great time with my wife. We went to the Amsterdam Bos and saw the blooming blossom trees. It was really nice to get out of the house and just enjoy the weather and the nature.

Also did some bathroom renovations, I am not a handyman by any means, but luckly we where only doing a bit of caulking and painting. I think it turned out pretty good!

## Am I the Imposter? 🤔

Imposter syndrome is rearing its ugly head again. I see people on social media doing these insanely smart and cool things and I feel like I will never be able to do that. It does keep me motivated to keep learning and keep trying to improve myself though so silver lining I guess. 

I know I am not the only one that feels this way, so if you do, don't worry, you are not alone!

## The Pragmatic Programmer 📚

I have been reading my new book and I am really enjoying it. I am only a few chapters in, but I am already learning a lot. I am looking forward to reading more of it. I think it should be a book all developers should read (or at least skim through).

## Amazon Codewhisper 🤫

AI this, AI that. Are we just riding the hype train? I don't know. I feel like AI has its place and can be useful I use it a lot to write documentation and debug stuff, but I feel like it tends to halluciante a lot. I am not sure if it is just me, but I feel like it is not as accurate as it could be. I am not sure if it is because I am not using it correctly (prompt engineering?) or if it is just not that good yet. I am not sure if I will continue using it although Copilot X looks very promising, so I will keep an eye on it and see if it improves.

Also is AI going to make us smarter? or more lazy?

## Open Source Summit 🌐

I was lucky enough to get a hobbyist ticket for the Open Source Summit in Bilbao. This time I am making a small holiday out of it and will be going for about a week with my wife. Weather should be nice, hotel has a pool and a spa so I am looking forward to it. I really enjoyed it in Dublin last year, so I am hoping it will be just as good this year.
