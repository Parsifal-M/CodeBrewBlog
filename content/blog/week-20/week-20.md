Hi everyone üëã!

I have been AWOL for the last week... or so.

This was due to being really sick with what I think was possibly COVID (again!) so apologies for the lack of updates. I am feeling much better now and I am back to work and back to writing these weeklies.

## Holiday Vibes üèñ

I had the whole week off, which was awesome. I planned a bit of a digital detox and I think I did pretty well. I did not check my work email once and I only checked Mastodon a few times. I did not do any coding or anything like that, I just relaxed and enjoyed the time off. My parents visited from the UK and it was the first time since we moved to Haarlem that they visited and had time to relax and enjoy some nice food and drinks. 

We had a great time and I am looking forward to them visiting again soon.

## DIWHY? üõ†

I suck at DIY, I get frustrated when trying to do it because it never seems to go right for me and I lose my patience. My Dad is great at DIY, he is a builder by trade so he can do pretty much anything, plumbing, electrics and all that jazz. I did used to go and work with him when I was a teenager for my pocket money but I think none of the skills I learned way back when really stuck with me. Although at a high level I know what needs to be done, most of the time I lack the tools and time to do it correctly.

When my Dad was over we did quite a bit of DIY and I enjoy spending time with him doing those things we don't get to do much together anymore and I know my Dad really enjoys it too.

## My Birthday üéÇ

I'm 33 this year and celebrated my birthday with my parents for the first time in absolutely ages. We went out for a nice meal at a place called [Toujours](https://restauranttoujours.nl/) in Haarlem. It was super good and we'll definitely go back at some point. I had the Ramen which is quite weird to be on the menu for a French Bistro! But it was delicious and I would definitely recommend it.

## WASM-ing with OPA

Before my holiday I was switched onto an [NPM-OPA-WASM](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/npm-opa-wasm) NPM Module I stumbled across while looking into WASM, OPA and Backstage and how to tie the three together.

I am hoping to try and play around with this a bit maybe this weekend or at some point during the week after I have caught up on all my work backlog.

I'm wondering if this could potentially help me with my OPA and Backstage integration work. I am going to see what I can cook up and see if I can get it working.

## AI Woes ü§ñ

Since I stopped using chatGPT I feel like I have been enjoying writing code and reading code again. The problem I had with AI is that it removed the "thinking" part of programming, I noticed I was getting into some bad habits of just copy and pasting what ever it dished out to me and then debugging and fixing it. I was not really thinking about what I was doing and I was not really learning anything new. I was just getting frustrated and annoyed at the AI and myself for not being able to get it to work.

I'm still cautiously optimistic about AI and things like Copilot-X but I do fear it will make us all somewhat lazy developers and promote bad habits and bad shortcuts.

## Expanding the Blog üìù

I wan't to eventually, expand the blog to have another section for tech write-ups and tutorials. I have a few ideas for some things I want to write about and I think it would be a good way to get some of my ideas out there and also help me learn and understand things better.

Watch this space for more on that!
